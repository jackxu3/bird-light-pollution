The underlying R code of the plots were written by AI tools.\nGitHub repository link: https://github.com/jackxu3/bird-light-pollution\nThis project was created as a part of Kane’s Free Data Science Bootcamp."

    "text": "Summary\nLight pollution affects rest and flight behavior of migratory birds. I gathered data from Kaggle showing three lesser black-backed gulls’ flight paths in 2013 and 2014. The dataset from Globe at Night – Sky Brightness Monitoring Network in 2023 shows light pollution levels. Using this data, we seek to understand the relationship between rest times and flight speeds of birds with light pollution levels. This data shows that more light pollution causes less bird rest times and higher flight speeds, which causes disorientation."
