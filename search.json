    "text": "Summary\nLight pollution affects rest and flight behavior of migratory birds. I gathered data from Kaggle showing three lesser black-backed gulls’ flight paths in 2013 and 2014. The dataset from Globe at Night – Sky Brightness Monitoring Network in 2023 shows light pollution levels. Using this data, we seek to understand the relationship between rest duration and flight speed with light pollution levels. More light pollution causes less time for bird rest and higher flight speeds, showing hyperactivity and disorientation."
