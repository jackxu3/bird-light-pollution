I got the bird migration dataset from Kaggle and the light pollution dataset from Globe at Night.

I cleaned the downloaded data by keeping the Latitude, Longitude, and LimitingMag columns and removing the rest of the columns.

I did not remove rows by changing the dataset itself, but the argument na.rm in the assignation to rest_summary ignores rows containing empty values.
